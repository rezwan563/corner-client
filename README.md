## CORNER APP

This is a learning project. I will try to implement all the essential things I have learnt over the last six months into this app. This is going to be social media app named CORNER. 

### Note to Myself

Using eslintrc teaches you the best practices while developing react app. It can bother you with the red file names. However, if you hover over why eslintrc doing this it will also give you hint how to solve it. You should use rel='noreferrer' when use target="_blank" in anchor tag.

While building the user interface I can't get my head around how to store data in database. Currently, I am thinking about MongoDB for the database. I can understand I need to store the users data in a document. That should be easy. But, with one users you have their posts, likes, friends, their private messages and so on. You get the idea. So, how should you store those data so that you can easily access those data in future? I was googling and learned two new terms **Data Modeling** and **Application Design** sounds intimidating!
